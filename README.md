# Dynamic-task-allocation-using-game-theroy-for-heterogeneous-robots
In recent years, the use of artificial agents such as robots is becoming increasingly common and the application of concepts derived from game theory to the study of multi-robot systems has gained popularity. In this report, we propose a sequential game-theory-based algorithm that enables dynamic task allocation for a team of heterogeneous robots. These agents are able to execute multiple tasks. Our algorithm aims to optimize task allocation based on the robotâ€™s energy consumption, the distance between robots and tasks, and the execution time of tasks. We formulate the problem as a game in order to assign roles to the different robots and demonstrate the performance of the proposed method through benchmarking with another algorithm and some experimental results analyses.
